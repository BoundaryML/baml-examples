# Node.js TypeScript BAML Project

Welcome to the Node.js TypeScript BAML Project. This project is designed to help you get started with BAML using Node.js and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

We assume that you have Ollama and Llama 3.1 (llama3.1) installed and running. If not, please check out [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for installation instructions.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: First, you need to install all the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: After installing the dependencies, compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript by running:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the Application**: Finally, start the application using:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. Here is a brief overview of the structure:

- **src/**: Contains the TypeScript source files.
- **dist/**: Contains the compiled JavaScript files.
- **package.json**: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file.

## Scripts

The `package.json` file includes several scripts to help with development and production tasks:

- `npm install`: Installs all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- `npm run start`: Starts the application.
