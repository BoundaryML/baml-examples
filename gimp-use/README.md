Code from the "Can Claude draw using GIMP?" talk.

The easiest way to run is with `poetry`, from this directory:

```bash
poetry run python app/main.py
```

You will need to supply the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable,
and have GIMP running.

Note that this project does not yet produce images. It is more of
a research project. We hope to achieve some better drawing results
in the future.
