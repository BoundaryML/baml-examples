# baml-examples
This is an example of a chatbot that can answer queries on a specific topic using a RAG pipeline in baml. A pdf containing the desired topic can be uploaed to the pdfs directory, where it will be turned into embeddings (by paragraph) for the LLM to more easily answer queries. Once these embeddings are generated, a user can ask either 1) a topic-specific query, for which the embeddings will also be generated, or 2) a clarification request for the previous response. For the first type of request, the 10 closest embeddings from the pdf to the query will be inputted as information for the LLM to use to answer the query. For the second type of request, the previous response and the previous information that the response was based on is inputted into the LLM in order to clarify the previous reponse accordingly.
